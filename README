                  F90GIO Release v1.0

Fortran 90 General I/O Interface (F90GIO) provides I/O interface for 
Binary, NetCDF, HDF4, HDF5 reading/writing by using Fortran 90
languages. It is developed in the hope to allieviate researchers'
pressure in atmospheric and oceanic science to deal with either re-
analysis, forecast, or remote sensing data. Instead of learning these
techniques, people may want to be more willing to focus on the science
problems. With this thought in mind, the author deliever this package 
to the public. Most of the routine have been tested both on Mac Pro 
and Linux clusters.

This README file contains information about: I. what compiler flags 
should be included when compiling NetCDF, HDF4, HDF5 libraries; II. 
how to compile F90IO library, III. how to use F90IO library.

I.   Install NetCDF/HDF4/HDF5 library
II.  Install F90IO library
III. Use F90IO library
